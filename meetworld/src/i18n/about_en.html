<div><img src="../meetup/about.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Dimension Meetup runs on the blockchain and is a blockchain integrated platform that integrates blockchain games, blockchain activities, blockchain ticketing and user-generated content.The Dimension Meetup code is fully open source, developed for community developers, and motivated by the notarization economy.</p>

<p>Dimension Meetup's existing Earth module combines gameplay and openness. The future development direction is determined by community consensus.</p>

<p>In the Earth module, we divide the land by level, such as the earth, continents, countries, cities, landmarks, etc.These game assets are NFT(Non-Fungible Token), unique and chain-ready.Dimension Meetup will combine different levels of land to achieve different ways of playing.</p>

<p>In the map module, users can upload the landmarks autonomously. The landmarks are recorded on the blockchain and become user assets. The coinju provides a rich gameplay, giving users the greatest freedom to create space. Users can buy and sell landmarks, define the attributes of landmarks, hold events on landmarks, and earn income.</p>
